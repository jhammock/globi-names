Want to help clean up fishbase names?

Follow the steps:

1. pick a file (e.g. a.tsv)
2. edit the file 
3. for each name suggestion you agree with, put "sameAs" in the name status field.
4. for each name suggestion you disagree with, put "different" in the name status field
5. if you don't know, just go to the next line.
6. whenever you are done, commit your results and create a pull request
